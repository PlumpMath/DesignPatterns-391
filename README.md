# DesignPatterns
This repository contains Object Oriented design patterns.
_All code is written in C# .NET framework_**

Currently implemented patterns:

# Strategy
**The Strategy pattern** defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets algorithms vary independetly from clients that use it.

# Observer
**The Observer pattern** defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of it's dependants are notified and updated automatically.

# Decorator
**The Decorator pattern** attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative of subclassing for extending functionality.

# Factory
**The Factory pattern** defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

# Abstract Factory
**The Abstract Factory pattern** provides an interface for creating families of related or dependant objects without specifying their concrete classes.

# Singleton
**The Singleton pattern** ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to it.

# Command
**The Command pattern** encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parametrize other objects with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

# Adapter
**The Adapter pattern** converts the interface of a class into another interface the client expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of inconpatible interfaces.
