# DesignPatterns
This repository contains Object Oriented design patterns.
_All code is written in C# .NET framework_**

Currently implemented patterns:

# Strategy
**The Strategy pattern** defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets algorithms vary independetly from clients that use it.

# Observer
**The Observer pattern** defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of it's dependants are notified and updated automatically.

# Decorator
**The Decorator pattern** attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative of subclassing for extending functionality.
